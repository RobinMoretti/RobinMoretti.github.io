This week, ragdoll journey: <a href="https://robinmoretti.itch.io/brume" target="_blank">Brume</a></i></p>

<p>Brume, by <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinMoretti" target="_blank">Robin Moretti</a>, is the strangest and most abstract of games that I’ve covered on Itching For More, in the same vein as <a href="https://plugplay.ch/" target="_blank">Plug and Pla</a>y (the strange interactive animation game released last year). Taking around five minutes to fully complete, Brume (for me at least) required multiple playthroughs to try to even begin to understand any form of message that it was trying to convey. 

Initially, Brume could be shrugged off as bizarre and impenetrable, but if you scratch a little deeper it reveals a host of interpretations and analysis.

</p>
<p><i>Before continuing, I’d suggest playing Brume! The rest of this discussion will be spoiler and interpretation heavy.</i></p>
<p>To begin with, let’s talk about Brume’s name. Brume, translates to mist or fog. Mists and fogs tend to obscure your vision, leaving you blind and unknowing, stuck on where to go, left to feel and hear your way through the mist. This is perhaps exactly what Moretti intends us to do - both through interpretation of Brume and in playing Brume.</p>
<p>The first action you commit in Brume is picking up an arm - a tool to help you feel through the mist, eventually arriving at a scene of death - bodies hang from rope, music growing abrasive and loud, hand contorting as you grab onto one and begin to fall. </p>
<p>Brume feels to be an allegory for falling into a bad cycle within life - you’re obscured by the cycle, unable to see where you lead yourself, convinced you are headed in the right direction before you stumble upon your inevitable destination, clutching at stagnation and death. You realise too late, hand twisting and contorting, begin to fall further, until you catch yourself - in Brume’s case, literally.</p>
<p>Yet the catch in Brume is sloppy and weak - fingers wobble about, the hand is mutated and wrong. You’re well aware of where you’re heading yet you continue. The scene that follows is perhaps the strangest in Brume - you begin to cough and splutter, small coughs at first until you begin to retch out a body, trying to expel your old self. Treated like garbage, you pile on top of the others eaten up and spat out by similar causes. Eventually you find yourself lost again, just an arm, grabbing and pulling others down with you, just one at first, escalating to a crowd.</p>
<p>Brume is loud, abstract and bizarre. Pinks and whites <b><i>scream</i></b> at you from every direction, music swirling in and out of the mists as you grab onto what you can, moving further and further into the mist and out of the sun. Your demise (represented by the arm) guides your body deeper and deeper. Moretti has created an intriguing piece, something that hides itself within the mists, beckoning you to follow it, before shoving you down a trap door.</p>
